# auto-annotator

This the source code I used for my master thesis. After eight years some of the snippets present here are still useful (the python code to analyze the Natural Language from websites) and other pieces should be reviewed or thrown away (the crawlers for search engine websites or the xml-rpc server). 

By the way, even though it's a piece of old and non-working software I spent a big effort at that moment creating and tunning it, and maybe somebody finds it useful to annotate natural language.
